# fake_review_detectionProject

This project focuses on detecting fake product reviews using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Fake reviews are a growing problem in e-commerce platforms, as they mislead customers and affect genuine businesses.
Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to classify reviews as Real or Fake.
Used NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF, etc.) to process review text.
Trained and tested classification models (Logistic Regression).
Achieved accurate prediction of fake vs. genuine reviews.
Built a simple web interface (Streamlit) to allow users to input reviews and get instant results.

Dataset
Dataset contains customer reviews with the following columns:
text_ → Review text
label → Fake (0) or Real (1)
